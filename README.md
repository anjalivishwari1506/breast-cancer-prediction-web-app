# 🧬 Breast Cancer Prediction Web Application

A modern, visually appealing web application to predict breast cancer using a **Random Forest Machine Learning Model** and a clean, responsive **Flask + HTML/CSS dashboard**.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project aims to assist medical professionals and researchers by providing a quick and intuitive tool to predict the likelihood of **malignant** or **benign** breast tumors based on various features derived from diagnostic data.

The application:
- Accepts **30 tumor-related input features** along with **patient details** (name, age, gender).
- Uses a trained **Random Forest Classifier** to predict the diagnosis.
- Displays a detailed **patient report** including all entered features and a final **diagnosis outcome**.
- Features a **modern and responsive UI** designed with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap/Tailwind (as needed).
- Built using **Python Flask** as the backend.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Scikit-learn** (for Random Forest model)
- **Flask** (for web framework)
- **HTML5 & CSS3** (for frontend styling)
- **Tailwind CSS** (optional for UI components)
- **Pandas, NumPy** (for data handling)
- **Jinja2 Templating** (for rendering forms and results)

## 📊 Features

- 📝 **Patient Form**: Collects patient info and 30 tumor-related diagnostic features.
- 🤖 **ML Prediction**: Uses a pre-trained `model.pkl` built with Random Forest for accurate predictions.
- 📋 **Report Display**: Shows results with a detailed breakdown and final diagnosis (Malignant or Benign).
- 💅 **Responsive Design**: Works smoothly across mobile and desktop devices.
- 🎨 **3D Cancer Visualization (optional)**: Adds an aesthetic, interactive element to enhance user experience.
